### Hey, I'm Sam Welsh.

---

I'm an aspiring Junior Software Developer. After working closely with the IT industry for 7 years as an IT Recruitment Consultant, in September 2020, I took the step to pursue my long-term career goal to become a Software Developer and invested in a Coding Traineeship provided by IT Career Switch. I have gained valuable experience with a variety of technologies and the best-practices within software development, as well as a [Microsoft MTA 98-383 certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/fb9143a1-761c-4112-918f-91d3902aa4ea/public_url).
